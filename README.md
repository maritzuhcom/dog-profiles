# Dog-profiles

### About
Hello, this is a app demo I made using React Native, Redux, Redux-Thunk, eslint, Axios,
Lodash, and Babel. Made it as a quick example over the weekend.
It was a little challenging when styling in React native since there is not a lot of documentation with some things.
Overall it was fun and it is always a learning experience.

To use in a development environment, simply `npm i` and `npm start`
